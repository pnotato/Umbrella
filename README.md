# Umbrella

A full-stack weather web app. Takes the current weather based on an inputted location and determines whether or not you will need an umbrella, as well as providing a forecast of the next two days. Features such as Fahrenheit and Celsius conversion added as well. 

Built with HTML, CSS with the Bootstrap library, and Python with the Flask framework.

My final project submission for CS50x.
